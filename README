"Hello World!"

8/5/2013 -- First Git repository, I give it a week to still confuse me, the layout and all that I mean.

Goal:

Store, organize, and modify SQL scripts I use to query data faster to help me troubleshoot and resolve client issues. Will help me keep my work quality high, as well as provide tools that may be able to assist other colleagues.

**I also pushed this from my local Git repository using Git bash
