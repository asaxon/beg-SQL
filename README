Hi!

If you've come across this page via a link from one of my profiles (LinkedIn, facebook, StackOverflow, etc), and want to explore some of my work, use checklist below to navigate:

1) SQL - beg-SQL (some queries I use to gather information, showing some formatting, next queries, functions, etc)
2) Python - beg-Python (python practice will be placed here)
3) Powershell - beg-PowerShell (powershell practice here)
4) Java - beg-Java (java practice here)
5) C# - beg-C# (C# practice here)



-----------------

8/5/2013 -- First Git repository, I give it a week to still confuse me, the layout and all that I mean.

7/22/2014 -- Been saving all my work locally, in process of transferring some items here to showcase things I've learned...more comfy with layout now.

Goal:

Store, organize, and modify SQL scripts I use to query data faster to help me troubleshoot and resolve client issues. Will help me keep my work quality high, as well as provide tools that may be able to assist other colleagues.

**I also pushed this from my local Git repository using Git bash
